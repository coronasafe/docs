## Overview

The length and complexity of patient discharge summaries can sometimes pose a challenge for healthcare professionals who need to quickly understand a patient's medical history. To address this, we have developed a unique feature in our healthcare management application that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to summarize these discharge summaries. This write-up provides a step-by-step overview of how this feature works, from the initial parsing of the discharge summary to the final presentation of the summarized data. 

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Breaking Down the Data 

Parsing the Discharge Summary The first step involves parsing the discharge summary into separate sections.

These sections include:

-   Admission Details
-   Symptoms at Admission
-   Diagnosis
-   Medication History
-   Treatment Summary
-   General Instructions
-   Special Instructions

#### Step 2: Anonymizing Patient Information 

Before any data is sent to the AI model, we ensure to anonymize any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the patient. This is done by identifying and replacing any direct matches of the patient's name with a generic placeholder. This step is crucial for maintaining patient privacy and adhering to data protection regulations. It ensures that the AI model does not process any sensitive information that could potentially identify the patient. 

Currently, the following properties are redacted from all the places before being sent:

-   Full name
-   Address
-   Phone number
    

#### Step 3: Sending JSON to AI Model 

Each JSON object is then sent one by one to the AI model, which is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4. This model has been trained on a diverse range of internet text, which enables it to generate a summarized version of the data contained within each JSON object. 

Prompt Structure:
```
SYSTEM: You are a healthcare AI tasked with generating a discharge summary for a patient. Given the patient details provided in the JSON format below, generate a summary of the data. SECTION TITLE  JSON OBJECT

#### Step 4: AI Model Processing

The AI model processes each JSON object independently and generates a summary for each section. This process is performed iteratively, starting from the 'Introduction' section and ending with the 'Special Instructions' section. 

Prompt Structure for subsequent iterations.

```
SYSTEM: You are a healthcare AI tasked with generating a discharge summary for a patient. Given the patient details provided in the JSON format below, generate a summary of the data. The following is a summary of the patient so far: SUMMARY of N-1 ITERATION With the above context, include the following information to the provided summary. SECTION TITLE  JSON_OBJECT
```

#### Step 5: Consolidation of Summaries 

After all the sections have been processed by the AI model, the individual summaries are consolidated into a single, comprehensive summary. Importantly, while generating the summary of each subsequent section, a summary of the previous sections is passed along in the prompt to the AI. This provides essential context, enabling the AI to maintain continuity and coherence in the overall narrative. The final summary, therefore, provides a succinct and contextually aware overview of the patient's hospital journey. 

A sample of summaries generated for each section:

- Patient Details: 

> The patient, a 23-year-old male with blood group B+, was discharged on
> August 13, 2023.

- Admission Summary:

> The patient, an outpatient, was admitted on January 4, 2023, with
> symptoms of fever and cough…

- Treatment Summary:

> The patient has been prescribed Amlodipine and Paracetamol Pediatric
> Syrup/Suspension IP for treatment. The Paracetamol is to be
> administered due to a headache. The patient is also advised to use a
> non-woven adhesive tape…

- Discharge Summary:

> The patient was discharged on August 13, 2023, at 8:58 p.m. after
> recovery. The patient is advised to continue taking any prescribed
> medications as per the instructions of the healthcare provider …… This
> discharge summary has been verified by Dr. Anuj Sharma.


#### Step 6: Presentation of Final Summary 

The final summary is then presented to the user, allowing healthcare professionals to quickly understand a patient's medical history and make informed decisions. 

A sample of the final summary after consolidating all the above summaries:

> The patient, a 23-year-old male with a blood group of B+, was
> initially admitted as an outpatient on January 4, 2023, under the IP
> No. 15484518. He presented with symptoms of fever and a persistent
> cough, which led to a diagnosis of acquired iron deficiency anaemia
> due to blood loss (ID 942744561). His medical history revealed no
> co-morbidities, and he reported no allergies. His ongoing medication
> included Acetaminophen 500mg for fever, cough syrup, antibiotics, and
> iron supplements 
> 
> The treatment plan was updated to include Amlodipine Tab IP (Film
> Coated), 5 mg IV OD, and Paracetamol Paediatric Syrup/Suspension IP,
> 125mg/5ml 12 mg IV HS for 12 days due to a headache. Non-Woven
> Adhesive Tape, 2.5cm X 9.1 mtr, 6 mg was also prescribed. Nutritional
> support was provided to manage the iron deficiency anemia, and steam
> inhalation was recommended for symptomatic relief. Comfort care
> included ice pack application on the head every 6 hours. 
> 
> Investigations included a Urine Test (GROUP) every 6 hours to identify
> any underlying causes. Special instructions included administering an
> ice pack on the patient's head every 6 hours to manage the elevated
> body temperature. The patient was admitted for further observation and
> treatment, and comfort care was provided during the hospital stay. 
> 
> On January 15, 2023, the patient's condition was noted as critical,
> with symptoms of fever, cough, and breathlessness. On August 13, 2023,
> a series of urine tests were conducted, the results of which were
