This section details the operational flow of the Care Scribe feature, from the initiation of voice recording to the final form submission.

### High-Level Feature Operation

Care Scribe enhances user interaction with form fields through voice commands. The feature operates by:

1. Initiating voice recording when a user visits a form and activates the 'Voice Autofill' option.
2. Stopping the recording on user command and processing the audio data.
3. Transcribing the voice recording into text and mapping the transcription to the relevant form fields.
4. Updating the form with the transcribed data and submitting it to the backend.

The process is designed to be intuitive and efficient, minimizing the need for manual text entry and reducing the potential for data entry errors.

### Detailed Flowchart Explanation

![flowchart](assets/flowchart.png)

The flowchart outlines the step-by-step process of the Care Scribe feature. Below is an explanation of each step:

- **Form Visit**: The user navigates to a form within the application.
- **Click Voice Autofill**: The user initiates the voice autofill feature.
- **Start Voice Recording**: Care Scribe begins recording the user's voice inputs.
- **User Clicks Stop Button**: The user ends the voice recording session.
- **Recording Reaches 20 MB or ~23 Minutes**: The system automatically starts a new recording session to prevent data loss and ensure manageable file sizes.
- **Start New Recording**: If the initial recording session is stopped manually or reaches the file size/time limit, a new recording session begins.
- **Push to Buffer[]**: Audio data is temporarily stored in a buffer as it is being processed.
- **Collect Recorded Files**: The audio files are collected for transcription.
- **POST /scribe**: The system creates a new Scribe object with `requested_by`, `form_data`, and sets the status to 'Created'.
- **PUT CreateUpload**: Prepares the collected files for upload.
- **For Each Collected File**: Each audio file undergoes the following process:
  - **Use external_id as association_id for Files**: Links the audio files to the corresponding form instance.
  - **Post Audio binary to signed S3 URL for the FileUpload object**: Uploads the audio to a secure S3 bucket.
  - **File Upload**: Completes the file upload process.
- **Poll /AIFormFill**: The system polls for the status of the AIFormFill object to be 'Completed' or 'Failed'.
- **Get Form Data**: Retrieves the latest form data.
- **Update State with New Form Data**: Updates the application state with the new data from the form.
- **Get AIFormFill Object**: Accesses the AIFormFill object for processing.
- **Fetch Audio Files**: Retrieves the audio files associated with the AIFormFill object.
- **Get S3 Signed URLs**: Obtains secure URLs for the audio files stored in S3.
- **Fetch Audio Content**: Downloads the audio content from S3.
- **Transcribe with Whisper API**: Uses the Whisper API to transcribe audio content to text.
- **Transcript -> Form Data**: Maps the transcribed text to the appropriate form fields.
- **Store Form Data**: Saves the mapped form data.
- **Update Status to Completed**: Sets the AIFormFill object's status to 'Completed' after a successful operation.
- **Celery Worker**: An asynchronous Celery worker performs tasks such as polling the status and updating the form data.

Each of these steps represents a critical point in the operational flow of the Care Scribe feature, ensuring a seamless and efficient form-filling experience for the user.

## Scribe Integration

This section of the documentation details the integration of the Care Scribe feature into the Care application backend, describing the functionalities, database migrations, API endpoints, and background job scheduling.

### Modules

The Care Scribe feature is composed of several key components that work together to enable voice-assisted form filling. Below we will detail each module's functionality and how they interact within the system.

**Frontend Voice Recorder with Audio Size Splitting**

The voice recorder is a critical component that manages the audio input from the user. It uses the `useSegmentedRecorder` custom hook to handle the recording process. This hook facilitates the splitting of audio data into manageable chunks to prevent file size from becoming too large, which is essential for efficient data transfer and processing.

```jsx
// Example usage of useSegmentedRecorder hook
const {
  isRecording,
  startRecording,
  stopRecording,
  audioBlobs,
} = useSegmentedRecorder();
```

When the audio reaches a predefined size limit or time duration, the recorder stops the current recording session and starts a new one, ensuring seamless user experience and data integrity.

**Uploading Files to S3**

Once the audio is recorded, the files are prepared for upload. This process involves creating a signed URL for secure file transfer and then uploading the audio data to an Amazon S3 bucket. This is handled within the `Scribe` component, which interacts with backend API routes designed for file management.

```jsx
// Example of the upload function within the Scribe component
const uploadAudio = async (audioBlob, associatingId) => {
  // ...code to handle file upload to S3...
};
```

**Backend Transcription and Data Extraction Task**

On the backend, a task is triggered to process the uploaded audio files. This involves several steps:

1. **Fetching Audio Files**: Retrieving the audio files from S3.
2. **Transcription**: Using OpenAI's Whisper to convert speech to text.
3. **Data Extraction**: Applying GPT-4 to interpret the transcript and extract structured form data.
4. **Task Completion**: Updating the `Scribe` object's status to 'Completed' and storing the extracted form data.

These steps are handled by a background worker task that ensures the process is asynchronous and does not block other operations.

**Frontend Form Filling**

After the backend processing is complete, the frontend `Scribe` component receives the structured form data. It then updates the relevant form fields accordingly, providing a smooth user experience. The component listens for changes in the `Scribe` object's status and reacts by filling in the form fields when the data becomes available.

```jsx
// Example callback function to update form state
onFormUpdate={(fields) => {
  // Update form state with the new data
}};
```

**Module Interaction**

The frontend voice recorder module starts the process by capturing the user's voice and splitting the audio as needed. It then interacts with the S3 upload module to transfer the files securely. Once uploaded, the backend task takes over to transcribe and extract data from the audio files, utilizing powerful AI models. Finally, the structured form data is sent back to the frontend, where the form-filling module populates the form fields with the extracted data, completing the cycle.

By understanding the functionalities and interactions of these modules, developers can maintain, troubleshoot, and extend the Care Scribe feature as required.

### Functionalities

The Care Scribe module adds voice recognition and form autofill capabilities to the Care application. The key functionalities include:

* **Voice Recording Management**: Handling the start and stop of voice recordings, managing file buffers, and pushing audio data to storage.
* **Form Data Processing**: Collecting and structuring form data, validating it against a JSON schema, and preparing it for AI processing.
* **AI Interaction**: Integrating with AI services for transcribing audio to text and generating AI responses to fill the form data.

Key components added with this feature include:

* `Scribe`: A Django model that represents the form filling session and stores the transcription, AI response, and the status of the processing.
* `ScribeFile`: Extends the `FileUpload` model to handle specific file types associated with the Scribe feature.
* `ScribeSerializer`: Handles the serialization and deserialization of Scribe data for RESTful interaction.

### Database Migrations

The integration includes migrations to create new models in the database:

* `0001_initial.py`: This migration sets up the initial structure of the `Scribe` and `ScribeFile` models in the database.

### API Endpoints

New endpoints are added to manage the Scribe feature:

* `/api/scribe/`: Endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating `Scribe` objects.
* `/api/scribe_file/`: Endpoints for managing the file uploads related to the `Scribe` objects.

These endpoints allow the frontend to start a form filling session, manage audio file uploads, and fetch the status and results of the AI processing.

### Background Jobs and Scheduling

To process the audio recordings asynchronously and update the form data with AI-generated responses, Care Scribe leverages Celery, a distributed task queue:

* `tasks/scribe.py`: Defines the Celery tasks for processing form fillings, such as `process_ai_form_fill`, which coordinates the AI transcription and response generation.

These tasks are queued up when a `Scribe` object's status is set to 'Ready' and are processed in the background without blocking the main application flow.

#### Example Celery Task

Here's an example of a Celery task that orchestrates the AI form filling process:

```python
@shared_task
def process_ai_form_fill(external_id):
    # Fetch the Scribe object and associated audio files
    # Generate transcript using AI service
    # Process transcript with AI to fill form
    # Update Scribe object with the AI response and set status to 'Completed'
```

The task is designed to handle various steps in the AI form filling process, including error handling to update the `Scribe` status to 'Failed' if any step encounters an issue.

## Frontend Integration

![UI](assets/frontend.png)

Integrating the Care Scribe feature into the frontend involves updating the React components, state management, event handling, and ensuring the UI/UX and accessibility features are considered.

### Frontend Architecture Overview

The frontend architecture is built on React, utilizing functional components and hooks for state management. The integration of Care Scribe adds new components related to voice recording and form handling, which interact with the existing Redux store and backend API.

### Components and State Management

New components and hooks have been introduced to manage the state of voice recording and form data:

* `Scribe.tsx`: The primary component that handles voice recording, audio data management, and interaction with the backend to post form data.
* `formDetails.ts`: Contains the metadata and schema of form fields that can be auto-filled using the Scribe feature.
* `useSegmentedRecorder.ts`: A custom hook that manages voice recording, including starting, stopping, and segmenting the audio as it's recorded.

The state of the Scribe component is managed using local state hooks like `useState` and external state management using Redux for asynchronous actions and API interactions.

### Event Handlers

Event handlers within the Scribe component control the flow of user interactions:

* Voice recording is initiated and controlled through button clicks, triggering corresponding methods in the `useSegmentedRecorder` hook.
* Form updates are handled via callbacks when the transcription process is completed and the data is ready to be filled in the form.

### UI/UX Considerations

UI updates include:

* Adding a microphone icon to indicate voice recording capability.
* Visual feedback during recording, processing, and transcription phases.
* Modals and progress indicators to enhance user feedback during the operation of the Scribe feature.

### Accessibility Features

The Scribe component is designed with accessibility in mind:

* Keyboard navigable controls for starting and stopping recordings.
* ARIA labels and roles to ensure screen readers correctly interpret the purpose of the Scribe components and provide appropriate feedback to users with visual impairments.

#### Code Snippets

The following snippets from the patch files demonstrate key aspects of the Scribe feature integration:

```jsx
// src/Components/Scribe/Scribe.tsx
// Example of the Scribe component initialization
<Scribe
  fields={DAILY_ROUND_FORM_SCRIBE_DATA}
  onFormUpdate={(fields) => {
    // Update form state with new fields
  }}
/>

// src/Components/Scribe/formDetails.ts
// Metadata for daily round form fields utilized by Scribe
export const DAILY_ROUND_FORM_SCRIBE_DATA: Field[] = [
  {
    friendlyName: "Temperature",
    id: "temperature",
    type: "number",
    example: "98.6",
    // Other field attributes...
  },
  // Additional fields...
];
```

With the frontend integration complete, the application provides a seamless and accessible form-filling experience, leveraging voice-to-text technology to enhance user interaction with the Care platform.
