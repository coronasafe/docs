# Project Management

In Ayushma, projects serve as containers for organizing information and configuring settings related to specific medical domains or areas of focus. Each project can have its own set of documents, prompt, and AI model, allowing users to tailor the AI assistant's responses to the particular context.

### Accessing Projects

Users can access projects by navigating to the project section of the application, typically available at a URL like `https://ayushma.ohc.network/project/<project_id>`. The available projects and their accessibility may vary depending on the user's permissions and the project's configuration.

### Project Structure and Components

* **Title and Description:** Each project has a title and an optional description that provides an overview of its purpose and scope.
* **Documents:** Projects can contain a collection of documents that serve as reference materials for the AI assistant. These documents can include medical textbooks, research papers, clinical guidelines, or any other relevant materials.
* **Prompt:** The prompt is a set of instructions or guidelines that define the AI assistant's behavior and response style within the context of the project. It helps to tailor the AI's responses to the specific domain and objectives of the project.
* **AI Model:** Projects can be configured to use different AI models, each with its own strengths and capabilities. The choice of AI model can influence the accuracy, fluency, and style of the AI's responses.

### How Projects Work

When a user interacts with Ayushma within a specific project, the AI assistant utilizes the project's documents, prompt, and AI model to generate responses. The documents provide the AI with relevant background knowledge and context, while the prompt guides the AI's behavior and response style. The AI model processes the user's query and generates a response based on the combined information from the project's components.

### Benefits of Using Projects

* **Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Projects enable users to provide the AI assistant with specialized knowledge in a particular medical domain, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
* **Customization:** Users can customize the AI assistant's behavior and response style within each project through the prompt and AI model selection.
* **Organization:** Projects help to organize information and settings, making it easier to manage multiple areas of focus or medical domains.

### Project Visibility and Access

* **Default Project:** Upon initial login or when no specific project is selected, users are usually directed to a default project. This project often contains general medical knowledge and serves as a starting point for conversations.
* **Project Selection:** Users can switch between available projects using a project slug which need to be entered in the URL format specified at the first section of this page.

### Using Projects

* **Contextual Conversations:** When interacting with the AI assistant within a project, the AI's responses will be informed by the documents, prompt, and AI model associated with that project. This allows for more relevant and accurate answers to user queries.
* **Switching Projects:** Users can switch between projects to access different knowledge domains and adjust the AI's responses accordingly. This is helpful when dealing with diverse medical cases or areas of expertise.
* **Exploring Preset Questions:** The preset questions within a project can provide users with a starting point for conversations and help them discover the capabilities of the AI assistant.
