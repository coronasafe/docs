### Managing Conversations

* **Multiple Chats**: The sidebar displays a list of past conversations, organized by project or by individual chat sessions. Users can easily switch between different conversations and review their history.
* **Chat Titles**: Each chat session is assigned a title, which can be edited by the user or automatically generated based on the content of the conversation. This helps with organization and quick identification of relevant chats.
* **Message Types**: Messages in the conversation history are categorized into three types:
  * **User**: Messages sent by the user to the AI assistant.
  * **Ayushma**: Responses generated by the AI assistant.
  * **System**: Messages related to system events or errors.
* **Language**: Each conversation has a specific language setting. Users can choose the language on a per-chat basis, ensuring that Ayushma understands and responds in the appropriate language.
* **History Storage**: Ayushma stores all conversation history, allowing users to access past interactions for reference or review. This feature is particularly useful for tracking progress, revisiting medical information, or analyzing patterns in queries.
* **Admin Access**: Authorized administrators have access to view conversation history for all users and projects. This facilitates monitoring, quality control, and data analysis for improvement purposes.
* **Deletion**: Users and admins can delete individual chats from the history if needed.

### Additional Insights from Code

* **Reference Documents**: The code indicates that Ayushma might store references to documents used in generating responses. This allows users and admins to see the sources of information that informed the AI assistant's answers.
* **Metadata**: Each message might include metadata such as timestamps and potentially other relevant information. This data can be useful for analyzing response times, identifying patterns, and understanding the context of conversations.
* **Chat Feedback**: Users might have the option to provide feedback on individual messages, indicating whether they were helpful or not. This feedback can be valuable for improving Ayushma's performance and tailoring its responses to user needs.

### Benefits of Conversation History

* **Continuity**: Users can easily resume previous conversations and avoid repeating information.
* **Learning and Improvement**: Reviewing past interactions helps users learn from previous queries and understand Ayushma's capabilities better.
* **Accountability and Transparency**: Conversation history provides a record of interactions, ensuring transparency and accountability for both users and the AI assistant.
* **Data Analysis**: The stored history enables admins to analyze usage patterns, identify areas for improvement, and enhance Ayushma's performance over time.
