### Chat Components

* **Input Box**: This is where users type their questions or prompts for the AI assistant. The input box can accept free-form text, allowing users to express their queries in natural language.
* **Send Button**: After typing their query, users click the send button to submit it to the AI assistant.
* **Microphone Button**: This button allows users to interact with Ayushma through voice input. Clicking the microphone button activates the speech-to-text functionality, enabling users to speak their questions or prompts.
* **Conversation History**: The chat history displays the ongoing conversation between the user and the AI assistant. Each message is presented with clear visual cues to differentiate user inputs and AI responses.
* **Language Selection**: Users can choose the language for both input and output. Ayushma supports multiple languages, allowing for communication in the user's preferred language.

### Chat Functionality

* **Text Input and Output**: Users can type their queries in the input box and receive text responses from the AI assistant. The responses are presented in a clear and readable format, often including relevant information, explanations, or suggestions.
* **Speech-to-Text**: The microphone button activates speech-to-text functionality, allowing users to speak their queries instead of typing. Ayushma converts the speech to text and processes it as a regular text input.
* **Text-to-Speech**: Ayushma can provide audio output for its responses. This feature is helpful for users who prefer to listen to information or have difficulty reading text.
* **Autoplay**: Users can enable or disable the autoplay function, which automatically plays the audio output of AI responses when available.
* **Reference Documents**: Ayushma might highlight reference documents used to generate responses. Users can click on these references to access the source material and gain deeper insights.

### Tips for Effective Chat Interaction

* **Clear and Concise Language**: Use simple and direct language to phrase your questions or prompts. This helps the AI assistant understand your intent accurately.
* **Specific Questions**: Ask specific questions rather than broad or open-ended ones. This allows Ayushma to provide more focused and relevant answers.
* **Provide Context**: If necessary, provide context or background information to help the AI assistant understand your query better.
* **Use Keywords**: Include relevant keywords in your queries to guide the AI assistant towards the information you're seeking.
* **Feedback**: Provide feedback on the AI assistant's responses, such as indicating whether they were helpful or not. This helps to improve Ayushma's performance over time.
