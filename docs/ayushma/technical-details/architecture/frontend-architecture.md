# Frontend Architecture

### Core Pages and Functionalities

* **Home Page:** This serves as the landing page for users, often including an overview of Ayushma's capabilities, key features, and options to either register or log in.
* **Authentication (Login, Registration, Password Reset):** Provides functionalities for user registration, login, and password reset, ensuring secure access to the platform.
* **Chat Interface:** The central hub for user interactions with the AI assistant. It includes components like:
  * **Chat Input**: Where users can type or speak their queries.
  * **Conversation History**: Displays the ongoing conversation between the user and Ayushma, with clear distinction between user messages, AI responses, and system messages.
  * **Chat Sidebar**: Houses options for starting new chats, searching past conversations, and accessing settings.
  * **Language Selection**: Allows users to choose the language for input and output on a per-chat basis.
  * **Audio Controls**: Provides options to play, pause, or stop audio output for AI responses, as well as manage autoplay settings.
* **Project Management**:
  * **Project List**: Displays available projects that users can access based on their permissions.
  * **Project Details**: Provides an overview of a specific project, including its title, description, associated documents, prompt (if applicable), and preset questions.
  * **Document Viewer**: Allows users to view the content of reference documents linked to projects.
* **Admin Panel**: (Accessible only to users with admin privileges)
  * **Project Administration**: Enables admins to create, edit, and manage projects, configure AI settings, and handle document uploading and organization.
  * **User Management**: Provides tools to oversee user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and control access to the platform.
  * **Test Suite Management**: Allows admins to create and manage test suites for evaluating the AI assistant's performance.
  * **Test Run Management**: Enables admins to view and analyze the results of test runs, providing insights into the AI's strengths and weaknesses and guiding further improvements.

### Frontend Technologies and Libraries

* **Next.js**: The core framework for building the frontend, providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and efficient routing capabilities.
* **React**: The underlying JavaScript library for building user interfaces and managing component states.
* **Jotai**: A state management library that simplifies state management and data flow across components.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines styling and ensures a consistent design language throughout the application.
* **Tanstack React Query**: Optimizes data fetching and caching, improving the performance and responsiveness of the application, particularly when dealing with large datasets or frequent API interactions.
* **Additional Libraries**: Ayushma may incorporate various other libraries for specific functionalities, such as audio recording, charting, PDF generation, and accessibility enhancements.

### Design Considerations and Trade-offs

* **Modularity and Reusability**: The frontend architecture emphasizes modularity, breaking down functionalities into reusable components. This promotes maintainability, code organization, and efficient development.
* **Performance Optimization**: Techniques like server-side rendering, static site generation, and data caching are employed to ensure fast loading times and a responsive user experience.
* **Accessibility**: The frontend design should prioritize accessibility, following best practices to ensure the application is usable by individuals with disabilities.
* **Scalability**: The architecture should be scalable to accommodate future growth, such as the addition of new features, support for more languages, and increased user traffic.
* **Maintainability**: The codebase should be well-organized, documented, and easy to maintain, enabling ongoing development and updates.

### **Component Structure**

The frontend is composed of various components, including:

* **Layout Components**: Define the overall structure and layout of the application, including headers, sidebars, and content areas.
* **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements such as buttons, inputs, and modals, providing a consistent look and feel throughout the application.
* **Page Components**: Represent individual pages or sections of the application, such as the chat interface, project management pages, and admin dashboards.
* **Data Fetching Components**: Responsible for retrieving data from the backend API using libraries like Tanstack React Query.
* **State Management**: Jotai manages the application state and ensures data consistency across different components.
